# WebSim-Inspired Hacking Simulator: Proof of Concepts

This is a collection of documents exploring the feasibility and technical approach for creating an AI-powered hacking simulator inspired by games like Grey Hack, but leveraging WebSim's generative architecture.

## Repository Contents

- **proof-of-concept-research.md**: Core technical analysis of WebSim's architecture and how it can be extended to generate procedural computer systems beyond simple web pages
- **websim-greyhack-deepresearch.md**: Exploration of Grey Hack's mechanics and how they might be replicated using WebSim's approach
- **understanding-websim.md**: Breakdown of WebSim's core functionality and underlying technology
- **ultimate-output.GDD.md**: Game Design Document outlining our vision for the final product

## Project Vision

The ultimate goal is to create a modern, AI-powered version of Grey Hack that leverages generative AI to create:

1. **Procedurally Generated Computer Networks**: Complete with unique IPs, services, vulnerabilities, and user accounts
2. **Dynamic Terminal Experience**: A realistic command-line interface for interacting with these virtual systems
3. **Complex System Simulation**: Beyond simple UI generation, actual simulation of operating systems, network protocols, and security vulnerabilities
4. **Web-Based Deployment**: Making the game accessible through browsers with no installation required

## Technical Approach

Rather than using WebSim.ai directly as a platform, we're analyzing its multi-layered generative pipeline:

1. **Semantic URL + Prompt Deconstruction**: Using structured paths to inform content generation
2. **Layered Generation Pipeline**: 
   - Foundation layer (OS type, vulnerabilities)
   - Style layer (system UI themes)
   - Interaction layer (terminal commands, file structures)
   - Execution layer (final system state)

3. **Generate "Host Objects"**: Instead of just web pages, creating complete procedural machine definitions
4. **Sandbox and Validation**: Ensuring generated systems maintain internal consistency

## Development Path

We're planning a lightweight web-based approach using frameworks like Phaser or similar JavaScript tools for rapid prototyping and deployment. This allows for:

1. Native browser support without plugins
2. Rapid iteration with immediate feedback
3. Focus on 2D UI that's perfect for terminal-based gameplay
4. Easy integration with AI tools for content generation

## Next Steps

- Finalize the core architecture for procedural system generation
- Build a prototype of the terminal UI and basic command parsing
- Implement a simple network simulation with a few connected nodes
- Develop the AI-driven content generation pipeline for creating varied and interesting scenarios

This project represents a novel approach to game development that leverages AI not just for content creation but for core gameplay systems.
