# Development Plan: AI-Driven Hacking Simulation Game (Web-Based)

**Overview:** We will leverage AI-powered tools for design, research, and coding to rapidly prototype a hacking simulation game inspired by Grey Hack and WebSim. The game will run in the browser with a 2D, terminal-centric interface, featuring realistic network hacking, AI-generated content, and procedural elements.

## Step 1: Ideation & Game Design with Ludo.ai  
**Use Ludo.ai to brainstorm and document the game concept.** Start by generating ideas and a Game Design Document (GDD) using Ludo's *Game Concept* and *Ideation* features. Ludo can quickly propose game concepts, story elements, and even suggest art/style inspirations tailored to hacking themes.

- **Asset and Aesthetic Inspiration:** Utilize Ludo's image generation to mock up the look and feel of the interface. For instance, generate images of "futuristic terminal screens" or "network maps" to guide your UI design.

- **Tutorial Guidance:** Take advantage of Ludo's *tailored development guides*. Once the concept is set, Ludo can create a custom step-by-step tutorial based on your game idea.

## Step 2: Deep Research with Perplexity.ai  
**Research hacking mechanics and technical references using Perplexity.ai.** With a solid concept in hand, dive into specifics to ensure realism and feasibility. Perplexity is an AI-powered answer engine that gives accurate, cited answers from across the web – perfect for quick research on topics like "UNIX commands to include," "simulating network latency," or "procedural generation algorithms for networks."

Research questions might include:
- "**What commands do real hacking simulators use?**"
- "**How to design a realistic network simulation in a game?**"
- "**UI patterns for terminal-based games**"

## Step 3: Using Phaser for Web Deployment  
**We'll use a lightweight HTML5 engine like Phaser** for our web-based hacking simulator. Key advantages include:

- **Native Browser Support:** Phaser is built for HTML5 and runs directly in modern browsers with no plugins – perfect for a WebSim-like experience.

- **Rapid Prototyping with JavaScript:** Phaser uses JavaScript/TypeScript, which, combined with AI coding assistance, makes iteration extremely fast.

- **2D and UI Focus:** Phaser excels at 2D rendering and has simple APIs for text, sprites, and input - perfect for our terminal-based UI.

- **Easy Integration with AI Tools:** Using a JS engine means we can leverage AI coding assistance effectively.

## Step 4: AI-Assisted Prototyping with Cursor IDE  
**Develop the game rapidly by coding with AI assistance.** With the design in place and the engine chosen, we'll code the prototype using AI-integrated development tools:

- **Project Setup:** Create a basic Phaser project (HTML file, a JS entry point, include the Phaser library).

- **Implement Core Features with AI Prompts:** We'll tackle one feature at a time:
  - *Terminal Interface:* A fullscreen text console with input handling and command history
  - *Command Parsing:* A system to recognize commands like LS, CONNECT [IP], SCAN
  - *Network Simulation:* Data structures for computer nodes with IPs, ports, etc.
  - *Procedural Content:* Generation of file systems, credentials, and network structures

## Step 5: Iterative Refinement and Content Expansion  
**Combine all tools in a feedback loop to refine gameplay and add content.**

- **Gameplay Tuning and New Ideas:** Revisit design tools to expand features as needed.

- **Deeper Research for Advanced Features:** Continue researching technical details for more complex features.

- **Testing and Feedback:** Regularly playtest the game in the browser, identify issues, implement solutions.

- **Procedural & AI Content:** Leverage AI to generate varied content (fake company names, credentials, file contents, etc.).

## Step 6: Optimizing the Workflow  
- **Partition Tasks Between Tools:** Use design tools for creative tasks, research tools for information, coding tools for implementation.

- **Maintain a Living Design Doc:** Keep the GDD updated as the project evolves.

- **Break Down AI Prompts:** Keep coding prompts focused and incremental for better results.

- **Test Continuously:** Maintain a checklist of test scenarios to verify after changes.

- **Human Oversight and Creativity:** Remember that while AI assists, human creativity and vision remain central.
