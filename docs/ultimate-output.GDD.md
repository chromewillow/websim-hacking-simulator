# WeaveNet Hacker – Game Concept Document

## 1. Game Presentation
**Title & Summary**  
**WeaveNet Hacker** is a 2D hacking simulation inspired by Grey Hack's "real computer" feel. Players use terminal commands to infiltrate procedurally generated systems, collecting data, exploiting vulnerabilities, and avoiding detection. Initially single-player, it can easily adapt for optional multiplayer—though the core sandbox focus remains on realistic, command-line interactions.

## 2. Core Mechanics
- **Mechanics**  
  - Terminal-based controls for scanning, enumerating, and exploiting hosts.  
  - Unique host configurations via procedural generation (file systems, open ports, logs, user data).  
  - AI-driven web apps to simulate realistic websites and potential infiltration targets.

- **Rules**  
  - Gain higher privileges by discovering and exploiting system flaws.  
  - Protect your anonymity: remove logs, hide traces, or set up backdoors.  
  - Hardware constraints (CPU, RAM) influence success rates and speed.

- **How to Play**  
  1. Boot your virtual workstation with default software.  
  2. Use scanning tools and common exploit scripts to breach insecure systems.  
  3. Upgrade your machine—improved hardware and advanced scripts unlock tougher targets.

- **Objectives**  
  - Execute hacking contracts for profit or personal gain (e.g. sabotage, espionage).  
  - Rise from a novice to an elite hacker, tackling well-defended corporate or government servers.

- **Strategy**  
  - Balance stealth vs. aggression: quick hacks risk detection, while methodical approaches minimize trace.  
  - Pinpoint weaker entry points or chain multiple low-level machines to pivot into high-value ones.

## 3. Additional Mechanics
- **Defeat**  
  - Being traced results in loss of equipment or forced data wipes.  
- **Rewards**  
  - Advanced exploit tools, new hardware modules, in-game currency.  
- **Resources**  
  - Exploit libraries, CPU cycles, and memory allocations.  
- **Levels**  
  - Reputation tiers that unlock more challenging or lucrative missions.  
- **Game Start**  
  - Intro tutorial showcasing how to scan IP addresses and brute-force basic passwords.  
- **Penalties**  
  - Fines, forced downgrades, or entire account resets if you're fully exposed.  
- **Difficulty Progression**  
  - Systems adapt to common exploits; advanced firewalls and faster trace times appear over time.  
- **Features**  
  - Single-player "sandbox" at launch. Multiplayer or co-op infiltration can be added later.

## 4. Theme
- **Theme**  
  - Realistic, "working computer" simulation—down-to-earth style.  
  - Color palette: cool tones—deep blues, purples, greens or red/cyan—accented by complementary pastel highlights.

- **Locations**  
  - Corporate LANs, personal home networks, "black-market" data hubs.  
- **Core Objects**  
  - Terminal windows, exploit tools, system logs, hardware upgrades.  
- **Storyline**  
  - Modern hacking world: digital heists, data ransom, or infiltration for moral or monetary objectives.  
- **Environments**  
  - Minimalistic OS desktops with multiple windows or a fullscreen console interface.

## 5. Characters
- **Playable Characters**  
  - Custom hacker avatars; progression based on skill and resources.  
- **Enemies**  
  - System administrators, advanced "counter-hacker" AIs, or corporate security teams.  
- **Companions**  
  - Script bots to automate repetitive tasks (optional).  
- **NPCs**  
  - Vendors, mission-givers, law enforcement, or random system owners.

## 6. Monetization
- **Monetization Model**  
  - Single purchase or optional expansions.  
- **Live Events** *(Future Consideration)*  
  - Timed infiltration challenges or limited-time missions.  
- **Marketing Strategy**  
  - Emphasize realism, demonstrate emergent hacking gameplay in dev logs.  
- **In-App Purchases**  
  - Cosmetic UI themes, optional mission packs—non-intrusive to core gameplay.  
- **Target Audience**  
  - Fans of hacking simulations, puzzle solvers, and players wanting a realistic digital infiltration vibe.  
- **Community Features**  
  - Script-sharing, leaderboards, asynchronous "challenge" modes if multiplayer is introduced.

---

## 7. Art and Audio
- **Art Style**  
  - Clean, utility-driven UI akin to real operating systems.  
  - Emphasis on minimalistic design with the chosen cool-tone palette.  

- **Sound Design**  
  - Subtle mechanical keyboard clicks, occasional beep or alert sound, and low ambient hum.  

- **Animation Style**  
  - Minimal transitions: scrolling text, cursor blink, opening/closing windows—reflecting a real OS environment.

---

## 8. Production
- **Technical Specifications**  
  - Preferably web-based (Phaser, Godot Web, or a JavaScript framework) for quick iteration and distribution.  
  - Potential for desktop builds (Electron) if needed.  

- **Controls**  
  - Keyboard input for terminal usage, mouse for window-based tasks.  

- **User Interface Elements**  
  - Multiple windows for terminal sessions, file browsers, logs, or hardware settings.  
  - Trace alerts or real-time logs to show infiltration progress and detection risk.

## 9. Standard Sections
- **Art**  
  - Focused on a realistic OS aesthetic, supplemented by color-coded logs.  
- **3D Assets**  
  - Likely unnecessary unless advanced visuals or cutscenes are desired later.  
- **Gameplay**  
  - Player-driven hacking sandbox, evolving network challenges.  
- **Games**  
  - Future expansions might explore deeper or more specialized hacking methods (mobile device hacking, specialized hardware, etc.).
